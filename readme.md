# Test-api

project to set-up a mock-up backend for a website with:
- User authentication (login, signup, logout)
- Database operations
- API endpoints for frontend interaction


# GPT-5 recommendations:

Great question. There are a few solid ways to add email/password login to an API. Below is a practical blueprint you can adapt, plus an alternative token-based approach if you need a more “API-first” style.

First, key terms:
- Authentication: verifying the user is who they say they are (login).
- Authorization: deciding what the authenticated user can access (roles/permissions).
- Two common approaches for web backends:
  - Session cookies (stateful): server stores a session; browser gets a secure cookie with session ID. Simple, secure, easy to revoke. Best default for a website.
  - Tokens (stateless): server issues tokens (e.g., JWT) that the client presents. Often paired with refresh tokens. Good when you have multiple clients (mobile, SPA on a different domain), but more moving parts.

Recommended default for a website: session cookie auth
- Why: Safer defaults, easy logout, simpler server logic, fewer pitfalls than rolling your own JWT system. Works great with server-rendered apps or SPAs on the same site.

Data model (minimum)
- users: id, email (unique, lowercased), password_hash, email_verified, created_at, updated_at.
- sessions: id (random), user_id, created_at, expires_at, revoked_at, user_agent, ip.
- email_verifications: id, user_id, token (random), expires_at, used_at.
- password_resets: id, user_id, token (random), expires_at, used_at.

Security must-haves
- Hash passwords with Argon2id (preferred) or bcrypt with a strong cost. Never store plain passwords.
- Validate inputs; use rate limiting for login and reset endpoints; add a small delay on failed login.
- Use constant-time compare for secrets.
- Lock account temporarily after many failures (e.g., 10 attempts within 10 minutes).
- Don’t leak which emails exist; use generic messages like “If that email exists, we sent instructions.”
- Log and monitor auth events (without sensitive data).
- Optional but recommended: 2FA (TOTP) later.

Cookie and CORS/CSRF
- Set an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookie for session_id.
- Use SameSite=Lax by default; if cross-site (frontend at a different domain), use SameSite=None; Secure and implement CSRF protection (e.g., double-submit token or Origin checks) on state-changing routes.
- If your API and frontend are on different domains, configure CORS to allow your frontend origin and include credentials.

Core flows (session-based)

1) Register (POST /auth/register)
- Input: email, password.
- Validate password strength and email format; normalize email (trim, lowercase).
- Hash password and create user with email_verified=false.
- Create email_verifications token and email the link (e.g., GET /auth/verify-email?token=...).
- Respond 200 with a generic message.

2) Verify email (GET /auth/verify-email)
- Validate token, set email_verified=true, mark token used. Optionally auto-login (create session and set cookie).

3) Login (POST /auth/login)
- Input: email, password.
- Find user, verify password hash. If email not verified, respond with instruction to verify (optionally re-send link).
- Create a session record with expiry (e.g., 30 days rolling or shorter).
- Set cookie:
  - Name: session_id
  - Value: random 256-bit token
  - Flags: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax (or None if cross-site), Path=/, Max-Age or Expires set to session lifetime.
- Respond with minimal user info and/or a CSRF token if you need cross-site requests.

4) Auth middleware (for protected routes)
- Read session_id cookie, look up active session, ensure not expired or revoked.
- Attach user to the request context.
- Optionally rotate session_id periodically to prevent fixation.

5) Logout (POST /auth/logout)
- Read session_id, revoke/delete the session, clear the cookie.

6) Password reset
- Request reset (POST /auth/request-password-reset): accept email, create token, email link.
- Reset (POST /auth/reset-password): verify token, set new password hash, invalidate all active sessions for that user.

7) Session management
- Endpoint to get current user (GET /me).
- Endpoint to list/revoke other sessions if you want “log out from other devices.”

Minimal endpoint list
- POST /auth/register
- GET /auth/verify-email?token=...
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/logout
- GET /me
- POST /auth/request-password-reset
- POST /auth/reset-password
- (Optional) POST /auth/resend-verification
- (Optional) GET/DELETE /auth/sessions

Implementation sketch (Node.js + Express example)
- Password hashing: argon2 or bcrypt
- Sessions: store in Redis or DB
- Cookies: set with res.cookie

Flow (pseudocode):
- POST /auth/register:
  - validate(email, password)
  - hash = argon2.hash(password)
  - insert user(email, hash, email_verified=false)
  - create verification token; send email
  - return 200
- POST /auth/login:
  - find user by email
  - if not user or !argon2.verify(hash, password): return 401
  - if !email_verified: return 403 with “verify email”
  - sessionId = randomBytes(32).toString('hex')
  - store session(sessionId, user_id, expiry)
  - res.cookie('session_id', sessionId, { httpOnly: true, secure: true, sameSite: 'lax', path: '/', maxAge: 2592000 })
  - return user profile
- Auth middleware:
  - sid = req.cookies.session_id
  - session = lookup(sid); if missing/expired -> 401
  - req.user = user
  - next()
- POST /auth/logout:
  - delete session by sid
  - clear cookie

Implementation sketch (Python + FastAPI)
- Use passlib (argon2/bcrypt), starlette responses for cookies, and a DB/Redis for sessions.
- Same flow as above; set cookie via response.set_cookie with httponly=True, secure=True, samesite="lax".

Alternative: token-based (JWT + refresh token)
- When to use: multiple clients, mobile apps, or cross-domain SPAs.
- Flow:
  - On login, issue:
    - Access token (JWT, short-lived, e.g., 5–15 min).
    - Refresh token (opaque random string or JWT), long-lived (e.g., 30 days), stored server-side with rotation.
  - Store tokens in HttpOnly cookies or keep access token in memory and refresh via HttpOnly refresh cookie.
  - Rotate refresh tokens on every use; revoke on logout or suspected theft.
  - Protect against CSRF if tokens are in cookies; if using Authorization headers and no cookies, CSRF is less of a concern but protect against XSS by not using localStorage.
- Endpoints:
  - POST /auth/login -> set refresh cookie and return access token
  - POST /auth/refresh -> validate refresh, rotate, return new access token
  - POST /auth/logout -> revoke refresh token(s)
- Be careful with token invalidation, rotation, audience/issuer claims, clock skew, and key management.

Operational considerations
- Email delivery: use a provider (SendGrid, Postmark, SES); include proper from/reply-to, rate limit sends.
- Environment secrets: store safely (dotenv, secret manager).
- HTTPS only in production. Secure cookies require HTTPS.
- Observability: structured logs, trace auth flows, but never log passwords or tokens.
- Testing: unit-test hashing/validation, integration-test full flows, simulate CSRF/CORS.

If you’d rather not build all of this:
- Managed identity providers: Auth0, Clerk, Stytch, Firebase Auth, Supabase. They handle hashing, sessions/tokens, emails, MFA, etc., and you integrate via SDKs and webhooks. This can save time and reduce risk.

What would help me tailor concrete code samples:
- Your backend stack (Node/Express, NestJS, Django/DRF, FastAPI, Rails, Go, etc.)
- Whether your frontend is same-origin or on a different domain
- Preference for session cookies vs JWTs
- Database choice (Postgres/MySQL) and whether you have Redis available

If you share those, I can provide a minimal, copy-pasteable implementation with the exact endpoints and middleware.

# API and DB SCHEMA details
Great! Since you have already created the database with the necessary tables, the next steps involve implementing the backend functionality using Python with FastAPI. Here’s a structured approach to help you move forward:

### 1. Set Up Your FastAPI Project

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install FastAPI and Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn passlib[bcrypt] python-multipart sqlalchemy databases
   ```

### 2. Define Your Database Models

Use SQLAlchemy for ORM and define your models based on the tables you created. Here’s an example:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Boolean, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./test.db"  # Replace with your actual database URL
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    email = Column(String, unique=True, index=True)
    password_hash = Column(String)
    email_verified = Column(Boolean, default=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime)
    updated_at = Column(DateTime)

# Define other models (sessions, email_verifications, password_resets) similarly
```

### 3. Create Dependency for Database Session

```python
from fastapi import Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
```

### 4. Implement Authentication Functions

You will need functions for hashing passwords, verifying passwords, and handling user registration and login.

```python
from passlib.context import CryptContext

pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    return pwd_context.hash(password)

def verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)
```

### 5. Create API Endpoints

Implement the endpoints as per your TO-DO list. Here’s an example for user registration and login:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

app = FastAPI()

class UserCreate(BaseModel):
    email: str
    password: str

@app.post("/auth/register")
def register(user: UserCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Validate email and password
    hashed_password = hash_password(user.password)
    # Create user in the database
    new_user = User(email=user.email, password_hash=hashed_password)
    db.add(new_user)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(new_user)
    return {"message": "User registered successfully"}

class UserLogin(BaseModel):
    email: str
    password: str

@app.post("/auth/login")
def login(user: UserLogin, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_user = db.query(User).filter(User.email == user.email).first()
    if not db_user or not verify_password(user.password, db_user.password_hash):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid credentials")
    # Create and set session here
    return {"message": "Logged in successfully"}
```

### 6. Set Up Middleware for Session Management

You can implement middleware to handle session cookies and protect routes as needed.

### 7. Run Your FastAPI Application

Run the application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
CORRECTIONS:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src poetry run uvicorn src.test_backend.api:app --reload
```

### 8. Test Your Endpoints

Use tools like Postman or Curl to test your API endpoints.

### 9. Implement Additional Functionalities

- Email verification
- Password reset
- Session management
- CSRF protection

### 10. Consider Security Best Practices

Ensure you follow security best practices as outlined in your TO-DO list, such as hashing passwords, validating inputs, and implementing rate limiting.

By following these steps, you should be able to build a robust backend with FastAPI for your application. If you have specific questions or need help with certain parts of the implementation, feel free to ask!

# Middleware
Setting up middleware for session management in FastAPI involves creating a custom middleware class that will handle session cookies, check for active sessions, and protect routes as necessary. Here’s how to implement it step by step:

### Step 1: Create a Middleware Class

You can create a custom middleware class that will intercept requests and manage session validation.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response, HTTPException
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from fastapi import Depends

class SessionMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # Extract the session_id from cookies
        session_id = request.cookies.get("session_id")
        
        # Check if session_id is present and valid
        if session_id:
            # Here you would typically look up the session in your database
            db: Session = request.state.db
            session = db.query(SessionModel).filter(SessionModel.id == session_id).first()
            
            if session is None or session.revoked_at is not None:
                raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid session")
            
            # Attach the user to the request state for later use
            request.state.user = session.user  # Assuming you have a user relationship
        
        # Proceed to the next middleware or request handler
        response = await call_next(request)
        return response

# Add this middleware to your FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Add middleware to the FastAPI app
app.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware)
```

### Step 2: Modify Your FastAPI App

Make sure to include the middleware in your FastAPI application, as shown above.

### Step 3: Protect Routes with Dependency Injection

You can create a dependency that checks if the user is authenticated by checking the request state.

```python
from fastapi import Depends

def get_current_user(request: Request):
    if not hasattr(request.state, "user"):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Not authenticated")
    return request.state.user

@app.get("/protected-route")
def protected_route(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {current_user.email}!"}
```

### Step 4: Handle Session Creation and Deletion

In your login and logout endpoints, ensure that you create and revoke sessions properly.

#### Example: Creating a Session on Login

```python
@app.post("/auth/login")
def login(user: UserLogin, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_user = db.query(User).filter(User.email == user.email).first()
    if not db_user or not verify_password(user.password, db_user.password_hash):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid credentials")
    
    # Create a new session
    session_id = generate_random_session_id()  # Implement this function to create a random session ID
    new_session = SessionModel(user_id=db_user.id, id=session_id, ...)
    db.add(new_session)
    db.commit()
    
    # Set the session_id cookie
    response = {"message": "Logged in successfully"}
    response.set_cookie(key="session_id", value=session_id, httponly=True, secure=True, samesite="lax")
    return response
```

#### Example: Revoking a Session on Logout

```python
@app.post("/auth/logout")
def logout(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user), db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Revoke the session
    db.query(SessionModel).filter(SessionModel.user_id == current_user.id).delete()
    db.commit()
    
    # Clear the session_id cookie
    response = {"message": "Logged out successfully"}
    response.delete_cookie("session_id")
    return response
```

### Summary

1. **Create a custom middleware class** to handle session validation and attach the user to the request state.
2. **Add the middleware to your FastAPI application**.
3. **Use dependency injection** to protect routes and check user authentication.
4. **Handle session creation and deletion** in your login and logout endpoints.

By following these steps, you will have a session management middleware in place that protects routes and manages user sessions effectively. If you have any further questions or need clarification on specific parts, feel free to ask!
