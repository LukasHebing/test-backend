# Test-api

project to set-up a mock-up backend for a website with:
- User authentication (login, signup, logout)
- Database operations
- API endpoints for frontend interaction


# GPT-5 recommendations:

Great question. There are a few solid ways to add email/password login to an API. Below is a practical blueprint you can adapt, plus an alternative token-based approach if you need a more “API-first” style.

First, key terms:
- Authentication: verifying the user is who they say they are (login).
- Authorization: deciding what the authenticated user can access (roles/permissions).
- Two common approaches for web backends:
  - Session cookies (stateful): server stores a session; browser gets a secure cookie with session ID. Simple, secure, easy to revoke. Best default for a website.
  - Tokens (stateless): server issues tokens (e.g., JWT) that the client presents. Often paired with refresh tokens. Good when you have multiple clients (mobile, SPA on a different domain), but more moving parts.

Recommended default for a website: session cookie auth
- Why: Safer defaults, easy logout, simpler server logic, fewer pitfalls than rolling your own JWT system. Works great with server-rendered apps or SPAs on the same site.

Data model (minimum)
- users: id, email (unique, lowercased), password_hash, email_verified, created_at, updated_at.
- sessions: id (random), user_id, created_at, expires_at, revoked_at, user_agent, ip.
- email_verifications: id, user_id, token (random), expires_at, used_at.
- password_resets: id, user_id, token (random), expires_at, used_at.

Security must-haves
- Hash passwords with Argon2id (preferred) or bcrypt with a strong cost. Never store plain passwords.
- Validate inputs; use rate limiting for login and reset endpoints; add a small delay on failed login.
- Use constant-time compare for secrets.
- Lock account temporarily after many failures (e.g., 10 attempts within 10 minutes).
- Don’t leak which emails exist; use generic messages like “If that email exists, we sent instructions.”
- Log and monitor auth events (without sensitive data).
- Optional but recommended: 2FA (TOTP) later.

Cookie and CORS/CSRF
- Set an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookie for session_id.
- Use SameSite=Lax by default; if cross-site (frontend at a different domain), use SameSite=None; Secure and implement CSRF protection (e.g., double-submit token or Origin checks) on state-changing routes.
- If your API and frontend are on different domains, configure CORS to allow your frontend origin and include credentials.

Core flows (session-based)

1) Register (POST /auth/register)
- Input: email, password.
- Validate password strength and email format; normalize email (trim, lowercase).
- Hash password and create user with email_verified=false.
- Create email_verifications token and email the link (e.g., GET /auth/verify-email?token=...).
- Respond 200 with a generic message.

2) Verify email (GET /auth/verify-email)
- Validate token, set email_verified=true, mark token used. Optionally auto-login (create session and set cookie).

3) Login (POST /auth/login)
- Input: email, password.
- Find user, verify password hash. If email not verified, respond with instruction to verify (optionally re-send link).
- Create a session record with expiry (e.g., 30 days rolling or shorter).
- Set cookie:
  - Name: session_id
  - Value: random 256-bit token
  - Flags: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax (or None if cross-site), Path=/, Max-Age or Expires set to session lifetime.
- Respond with minimal user info and/or a CSRF token if you need cross-site requests.

4) Auth middleware (for protected routes)
- Read session_id cookie, look up active session, ensure not expired or revoked.
- Attach user to the request context.
- Optionally rotate session_id periodically to prevent fixation.

5) Logout (POST /auth/logout)
- Read session_id, revoke/delete the session, clear the cookie.

6) Password reset
- Request reset (POST /auth/request-password-reset): accept email, create token, email link.
- Reset (POST /auth/reset-password): verify token, set new password hash, invalidate all active sessions for that user.

7) Session management
- Endpoint to get current user (GET /me).
- Endpoint to list/revoke other sessions if you want “log out from other devices.”

Minimal endpoint list
- POST /auth/register
- GET /auth/verify-email?token=...
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/logout
- GET /me
- POST /auth/request-password-reset
- POST /auth/reset-password
- (Optional) POST /auth/resend-verification
- (Optional) GET/DELETE /auth/sessions

Implementation sketch (Node.js + Express example)
- Password hashing: argon2 or bcrypt
- Sessions: store in Redis or DB
- Cookies: set with res.cookie

Flow (pseudocode):
- POST /auth/register:
  - validate(email, password)
  - hash = argon2.hash(password)
  - insert user(email, hash, email_verified=false)
  - create verification token; send email
  - return 200
- POST /auth/login:
  - find user by email
  - if not user or !argon2.verify(hash, password): return 401
  - if !email_verified: return 403 with “verify email”
  - sessionId = randomBytes(32).toString('hex')
  - store session(sessionId, user_id, expiry)
  - res.cookie('session_id', sessionId, { httpOnly: true, secure: true, sameSite: 'lax', path: '/', maxAge: 2592000 })
  - return user profile
- Auth middleware:
  - sid = req.cookies.session_id
  - session = lookup(sid); if missing/expired -> 401
  - req.user = user
  - next()
- POST /auth/logout:
  - delete session by sid
  - clear cookie

Implementation sketch (Python + FastAPI)
- Use passlib (argon2/bcrypt), starlette responses for cookies, and a DB/Redis for sessions.
- Same flow as above; set cookie via response.set_cookie with httponly=True, secure=True, samesite="lax".

Alternative: token-based (JWT + refresh token)
- When to use: multiple clients, mobile apps, or cross-domain SPAs.
- Flow:
  - On login, issue:
    - Access token (JWT, short-lived, e.g., 5–15 min).
    - Refresh token (opaque random string or JWT), long-lived (e.g., 30 days), stored server-side with rotation.
  - Store tokens in HttpOnly cookies or keep access token in memory and refresh via HttpOnly refresh cookie.
  - Rotate refresh tokens on every use; revoke on logout or suspected theft.
  - Protect against CSRF if tokens are in cookies; if using Authorization headers and no cookies, CSRF is less of a concern but protect against XSS by not using localStorage.
- Endpoints:
  - POST /auth/login -> set refresh cookie and return access token
  - POST /auth/refresh -> validate refresh, rotate, return new access token
  - POST /auth/logout -> revoke refresh token(s)
- Be careful with token invalidation, rotation, audience/issuer claims, clock skew, and key management.

Operational considerations
- Email delivery: use a provider (SendGrid, Postmark, SES); include proper from/reply-to, rate limit sends.
- Environment secrets: store safely (dotenv, secret manager).
- HTTPS only in production. Secure cookies require HTTPS.
- Observability: structured logs, trace auth flows, but never log passwords or tokens.
- Testing: unit-test hashing/validation, integration-test full flows, simulate CSRF/CORS.

If you’d rather not build all of this:
- Managed identity providers: Auth0, Clerk, Stytch, Firebase Auth, Supabase. They handle hashing, sessions/tokens, emails, MFA, etc., and you integrate via SDKs and webhooks. This can save time and reduce risk.

What would help me tailor concrete code samples:
- Your backend stack (Node/Express, NestJS, Django/DRF, FastAPI, Rails, Go, etc.)
- Whether your frontend is same-origin or on a different domain
- Preference for session cookies vs JWTs
- Database choice (Postgres/MySQL) and whether you have Redis available

If you share those, I can provide a minimal, copy-pasteable implementation with the exact endpoints and middleware.
